## What is a billing model?
A billing model is an essential component in peer-to-peer energy trading.

The peer-to-peer trading process typically consists of four phases:
- **forecast**; each peer creates a prediction of their energy consumption / production for the coming period.
- **auction**; each peer offers / bids for energy. The auction sets a trading price and connects the offers to the bids.
- **utilization**; during the predetermined period, each peer consumes / delivers energy.
- **billing**; each peer is billed / rewarded for their consumption / production.

One major obstacle in the billing phase of the trading process are discrepancies between the forecast and utilization phases.
After forecasting the energy consumption/production of a house for a given day, the sun may turn out to be a bit brighter than expected, or a surprise visit of a friend could have you bake them a cake; forecasts are rarely perfect.

A market must decide how to resolve these discrepancies.
One approach is to allow these discrepancies to occur, and settle them in the billing phase.
Several settlement strategies to address these discrepancies exist, ranging from individual to community-oriented solutions.
We refer to such a strategy as a _billing model_.
