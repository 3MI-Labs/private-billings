# Private-billings

This repository provides a proof-of-concept library that acts as a framework for performing privacy-preserving billing in peer-to-peer energy trading markets.
Background on billing in peer-to-peer markets is provided [here](billing_model.md).

Additionally, this library contains a default implementation of the _Universal Cost Split_ (UCS) model.
More details on this implementation of this model is provided [here](docs/universal_cost_split.md)

The messaging protocol employed by the application is explained [here](protocol.md).
